I"»<p>Well I was stuck for a day or 2 debugging an issue with my Sinatra project where flash was not working and one of the view of the project would not load the navbar. I must say I had spent some time researching and trying to debug. A least I read the docs for all this gem as well as looked around the repo of the gem I was user for help. Somehow I noted I was using the gem â‡’ Shotgun to start my app.</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$ shotgun</code></p>

<p>Well I must say after a while of reading the docs I came across the thin server of course I could just run the local thin sever instead of the shotgun gem, so I was reading the docs and found the command to run the server.
And to my surprise it all worked so something on the gem shotgun was not sending a proper session cookies to the web browser.</p>

<p>This is the command to run the local thin server. I also run with the optional â€“debug command so if any error are present they would be shown in the terminal in details.</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$ bundle exec thin start --debug</code></p>

<p>them just navigate to on your web browser to localhost:3000.
Thanks for reading!</p>
