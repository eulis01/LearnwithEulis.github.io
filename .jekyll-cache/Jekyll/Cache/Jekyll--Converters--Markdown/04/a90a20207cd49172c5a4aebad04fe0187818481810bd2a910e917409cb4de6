I"š<p>Well I was stuck for a day or 2 debugging an issue with my Sinatra project where flash was not working and one of the view of the project would not load the navbar. I must say I had spent some time researching and trying to debug. A least I read the docs for all this gem as well as looked around the repo of the gem I was user for help. Somehow I noted I was using the gem â‡’ Shotgun to start my app.</p>
