I"Ò<p>The reason I decided to begin to learn to code is kind of a long story, I have a Raspberry Pi build running and operating system of my choice and it has a fan hat as well but the software to make the fan bat work provided do not work with my pi operating system, so I need to learn how to code. To fix that problem. Iâ€™m only 22 and Iâ€™ve been an automotive technician for the past 4 years. Fixing things is what I like to do as well as solving problems I am mostly self-taught on everything, always learning a new thing every day I do what I can while working full time but Iâ€™m currently on unemployment most likely will be going back next month depending on howâ€™s everything goes with this global pandemic.</p>
