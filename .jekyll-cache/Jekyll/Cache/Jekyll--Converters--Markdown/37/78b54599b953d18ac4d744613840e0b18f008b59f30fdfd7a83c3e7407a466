<p>Hello everyone I know we’ll have reached a point where we feel lost, and not understanding what to do better to say being stuck. I have ruled myself to limit the time I spend doing research. How do I get unstuck? Personally I start by researching what I am trying to do for example how to add a ruby document or return an instance of the class. Looking up the error code and reading the ruby docs to learn new methods and operator to use on my code I would try to solve the problem out within 30 minutes. Stills nothing take a 10-minute break and give it another 5 minutes.</p>

<p>This problem is seen To be a little over my understanding I bet its something simple, so I go and reach out to my peer cohort students on the Slack channel if they cannot help me there usually I end up doing 1 on 1 with another student helping each other out. Most of the time we are looking at the problem from a different perspective and need some time to eat something or take a little walk. Come back and boom problem is resolved.</p>

<p>Let me talk about the first mile and how it’s a metaphor for life. First, it is an exciting challenge to take on and trying to stay consistent. However, the first mile pushed the student to socialize and communicate with each other, with the cohort support we can teach each other new things to see if we can explain the topic clear enough to our college and best parts we lean something twice once we can teach it. Personally, I am no a people person who has to break out of that shyness and fear I have to come forward and communicate my opinion or what I think about the topics in question. After I finished the first mile it really shows what we can be capable of doing if we just focus on what’s important and keep on moving forward. Thanks for reading this far I’m learning how to write stories I would appreciate any feedback.</p>
