The reason I decided to begin to learn to code is kind of a long story, I have a raspberry pi build running and operating system of my choice and it has a fan hat as well but the software to make the fan bat work provided do not work with my pi operating system so I need to learn how to code. To fix that problem. I’m only 22 and I've been an automotive technician for the past 4 years. Fixing things is what I like to do as well as solving problems I am mostly self-taught on everything, always learning a new thing every day I do what I can while working full time but I’m currently on unemployment most likely will be going back next month depending on how's everything goes with this global pandemic. 

I don’t know where I would’ve been today if I had not found career karma. I didn’t know there was such a high amount of people that switch careers all the time. I wish I had known about Bootcamp before I attended automotive school. But everything happens for a reason I believe so, I had learned a lot working as hard as I have been for the past year I always wanted to go I to study computer science but since my background is Hispanic and didn’t know too much mathematics I chose automotive as my passion. Still is until today. I never stopped fixing and playing around with computers. I think I can say I know enough to be dangerous, breaking things as well as fixing them. 

Coding has changed many lives. Let it change mine. And Your if you read this long. 
Thanks, Eulis Bonifacio
